##### Fullstackopen Backend course

The resource I'd been using to learn backend so far hadn't been very convincing. Multiple "knowledge gaps" were felt, as an example, suggesting the inclusion of random libraries in projects that magically do stuff instead of going through the process (or even pointing towards a resource where the process is explained) of explaining (example: not going over "manual" authentication at all and using 'passportjs' from the get-go).

This landed me in 'Fullstackopen' by the Uni of Helsinki, and it's been an absolute blast so far. I already sorta knew most of the concepts here, but a refresher is never a waste, can't wait to jump into unknown stuff!
Here we go over the basic operations of an API, HTTP request types (including some bits about safe requests), as well as middleware functions, and creating our own middleware. Not sure if it's because it's the second time I see these concepts or because everything is explained much better, but everything feels much more intuitive and easier.

Played a little bit with Morgan and familiarized myself some more with middleware, and tokens by creating a couple of custom ones and playing around with them.
